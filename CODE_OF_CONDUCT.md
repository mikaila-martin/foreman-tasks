# Foreman Community Code of Conduct
We have a variety of communication tools that the Foreman Community uses to get work done. The guidelines below apply in general when interacting with other Foreman users & developers:

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Community Guidelines
* Be nice: Treat people with respect and consideration.
* Be helpful: Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.
* Be patient: People often have many other things to do, so allow time for your question to be answered
* Stay calm: When in doubt, assume the best intentions and do not let emotions get out of control.
* Try to keep conversations on-topic where possible - going off on a tangent doesn’t solve anyone’s problem.
* Search first: Your question might not be new or you might be able to find someone who has already asked or answered your question. Do a thorough search of the [Manual](https://theforeman.org/), the [Redmine Issues](http://projects.theforeman.org/projects/foreman/issues), and the [Forum](https://community.theforeman.org/) to see if it has been answered before.

## Reporting Violations
Should you need to speak with someone about another Foreman member’s behaviour, email Greg Sutcliffe (greg@emeraldreverie.org, male) and/or Ori Rabin (orabin@redhat.com, female). We’ll do our best to listen to your issue fairly and take appropriate action.

## More Information
More information regarding the Foreman community can be found in the [Manual](https://theforeman.org/) and the [Forum](https://community.theforeman.org/).
