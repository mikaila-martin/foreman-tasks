Community Guidelines
We have a variety of communication tools that the Foreman Community uses to get work done. The guidelines below apply in general when interacting with other Foreman users & developers:

Be nice: Treat people with respect and consideration.
Be helpful: Be patient with new people and be willing to jump in to answer questions.
Be patient: People often have many other things to do, so allow time for your question to be answered
Stay calm: When in doubt, assume the best intentions and do not let emotions get out of control
Try to keep conversations on-topic where possible - going off on a tangent doesn’t solve anyone’s problem.
Search first: Your question might not be new or you might be able to find someone who has already asked or answered your question. Do a thorough search of the Manual, the Redmine Issues, and the Forum to see if it has been answered before.
There are also a few extra medium-specific guidelines, listed with each type of support below.

Reporting Violations
Should you need to speak with someone about another Foreman member’s behaviour, email Greg Sutcliffe (greg at emeraldreverie.org, male) and/or Ori Rabin (orabin at redhat.com, female). We’ll do our best to listen to your issue fairly and take appropriate action.
